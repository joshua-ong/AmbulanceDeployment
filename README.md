In 2019-2020, Austin EMS (Emergency Medical Service) served a total of 246,809 calls with an average of 338 calls per day with only 37 ambulances. In this repo we apply two-stage stochastic and robust linear programs to optimize ambulance stationing and routing. We further include data formatting, linear program solvers, simulation enginer, visulization, and GUI in a comprehensive package for use by the City of Austin and others!
