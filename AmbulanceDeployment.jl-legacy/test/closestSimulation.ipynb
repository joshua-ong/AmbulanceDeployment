    "Summary: This is a comprenhensive simulation engine for ambulance simulation. It uses the solution from two-stage stochastic program and robust programs to simulate how ambulances would perform. The simulation mostly runs using a priority-queue of events with respect to time. Events include things like ambulance arrives to the scene of call, ambulance arrives to hospital, ect."
